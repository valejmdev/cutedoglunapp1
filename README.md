# Cute Dog Luna Services
Welcome to my Website Project about my cute Dog Luna and the services she wants to provide.
It is complete with an contact form for potential dog lovers to get in contact with Me and Luna, an gallery section to show people some of Luna's beautiful pictures.
On the Homepage you can read all about Luna's Biography and find the services she offers to you.

This website has been created as the first Portfolio project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using HTML and CSS. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, GitPages was then used to deploy the website.

### Wireframes: 
- I created my Wireframes in preparation for the project.
- While creating the website you can see today, i had to change some elements for design and time reasons.

**Elements you might find missing from the live Website:**
- A picture of Me
- A calendar on the contact form
- Different Layouts have been changed for visibility and accessibility 

- To see all Wireframes, click [here](assets/docs/readmepages/WIREFRAMES.md)

Here is an example from my homepage:

### Color: 
- I have been inspired by the design of this [Website](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk).
- With that inspiration i created a color palette [here](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23006954&sub=1)
- On the website mycolor.space i chose the Discrete Palette, because the colors correspond with the colors of the images i uploaded:
![Discrete Palette mycolor.space](assets/docs/readmescreenshots/descretplatedesigncdlunapp1.png)

- I tested my Color Contrast with this [Website](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/fafafa-006954)

I got the following values, which solidified my design choice:

![Contrast Checker Header and Footer](assets/docs/readmescreenshots/contrast2cdlunapp1.png)
***
### Font: 
- I chose the current font, the Montserrat font family, as it is  a modern and versatile sans-serif typeface. Its clean design and legibility make it perfect for a wide range of projects, and its geometric design gives it a unique personality that can help make a website or design stand out.
[Google Fonts "Montserrat-Font"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=Cute%20dog%20Luna&query=Mon)
***
### Images: 
- All Images were taken by myself and Luna, Cesar and Flora gave consent to upload them. 
- I relied only on my own images, to avoid any copyright issues and to learn how to properly treat images i have taken myself.

## Features: 
### General:
