# Cute Dog Luna Services
Welcome to my Website Project about my cute Dog Luna and the services she wants to provide.
It is complete with an contact form for potential dog lovers to get in contact with Me and Luna, an gallery section to show people some of Luna's beautiful pictures.
On the Homepage you can read all about Luna's Biography and find the services she offers to you.

This website has been created as the first Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using HTML and CSS. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, GitPages was then used to deploy the website.

### Wireframes: 
I created my Wireframes in preparation of the project.
While creating the website you can see today, i had to change some elements for design and time reasons.
Elements you might find missing from the live Website:
-A picture of Me
-A calender on the contact form
-Different Layouts have been changed for visibility and accessibility 
Here is an example from my homepage:

### Color: 
I have been inspired by the design of this [Website](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk).
With that i inspiration i created a color pallete [here](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23006954&sub=1)
On the website mycolor.space i chose the Discrete Palette:
![Discrete Palette mycolor.space](assets/docs/readmescreenshots/descretplatedesigncdlunapp1.PNG)

I tested my Color Contrast with this [Website](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/fafafa-006954)
I got the following values:
![Contrast Checker Body Text](assets/docs/readmescreenshots/contrast1cdlunapp1.PNG)
![Contrast Checker Header and Footer](assets/docs/readmescreenshots/contrast2cdlunapp1.PNG)
***
### Font: 
I chose the current font, the Montserrat font family, as it is  a modern and versatile sans-serif typeface. Its clean design and legibility make it perfect for a wide range of projects, and its geometric design gives it a unique personality that can help make a website or design stand out.

-   All forms have validation and will not submit without the proper information.

### Mobile Testing

[](https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/horizon-photo/blob/master/README.md#mobile-testing)

-   The site was sent to friends and relatives for them to follow the same process. They have tested on their devices, only missing iOS devices.
- The testing was done using the Google Chrome Browser. Chrome Developer Tools was used extensively, particularly to check responsiveness on different screen sizes. Testing was also done using Firefox and Opera on desktop, and again on Google Chrome and Opera and Brave on the Nothing Phone (2).

### Desktop Testing
-   The site was developed on a Desktop PC and the majority of testing occurred on Chrome.
-   The site was tested by friends and relatives on numerous desktop devices.
-   The site was marginally tested on other browsers, such as Firefox and Opera.
-   Internet Explorer was not tested and the site was not developed with it in mind as support for the browser is gradually 		being dropped.

### Functionality
-   All links have been hovered and clicked to ensure accessibility.
-   Pages all load correctly on all device screen sizes.
-   All social media links work correctly and open on a new tab.
-   All images load on each page as intended.
-   All the buttons are working correctly and bring the users to the function that they were built for.

## Website Development Issues
    
At the initial stages of my project, I made an error how and when to use GitCommit and GitPush. Following my second call with my mentor he clarified how to do it and I have followed his recommended approach.

### W3C HTML: 
I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
To see all Screenshot of validation click [here](assets/docs/VALIDATION.md)

I used the [W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
