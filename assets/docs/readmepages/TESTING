## Testing:  

### General Testing
-   Each feature was developed on the main branch, 
-   Each time a feature was added, all the functions were tested to see if there was an impact.
-   The site was sent to friends for feedback and testing.
-   All forms have validation and will not submit without the proper information.
-   .gitignore file has been included to prevent system file commits.
-   The image loading blur has been thoroughly tested and gone through numerous iterations to optimise the smoothness of the transition on different devices and internet speeds.
-   Backup Map functions have been tested in a local deployment.
-   Email error functions have been tested offline as well.
-   External links open in a new tab.

### Mobile Testing

-   I tested the site personally on my Android device, going through the entire process, checking buttons, functions, checking out, etc. I was personally unable to test on iOS.
-   The site was sent to friends and relatives for them to follow the same process. They have tested on their devices, only missing iOS devices.
- The testing was done using the Google Chrome Browser. Chrome Developer Tools was used extensively, particularly to check responsiveness on different screen sizes. Testing was also done using Firefox and Opera on desktop, and again on Google Chrome and Opera and Brave on the Nothing Phone (2).
-   Responsive on all device sizes between 320px - 2600px wide.
- 
-   Devices tested using the Google Developer Tools emulator:

### Desktop Testing
-   The site was developed on a Desktop PC and the majority of testing occurred on Chrome.
-   The site was tested by friends and relatives on numerous desktop devices.
-   The site was marginally tested on other browsers, such as Firefox and Opera.
-   Internet Explorer was not tested and the site was not developed with it in mind as support for the browser is gradually 		being dropped.

### Functionality
-   All links have been hovered and clicked to ensure accessibility.
-   Pages all load correctly on all device screen sizes.
-   All social media links work correctly and open on a new tab.
-   All images load on each page as intended.
-   All the buttons are working correctly and bring the users to the function that they were built for.
-   I have checked that the contact form requires valid inputs and can't be submited without them.

## Website Development Issues
    
At the initial stages of my project, I made an error how and when to use GitCommit and GitPush. Following my second call with my mentor he clarified how to do it and I have followed his recommended approach.
